# WWPass Redmine authentication

WWPass Redmine Plugin that implements a secure authentication based on WWPass technology and LDAP. 

With WWPass, users can conveniently access multiple applications and on-line resources using the same PassKey to prove their identity. The identity data for each WWPass enabled application is stored separately in the cloud and this data is not shared between applications.  The data can only be retrieved and reassembled with the user’s consent and then, only after the application has been verified as authentic by WWPass using our multi-lateral authentication process. Our approach can prevent data breaches by eliminating the weakest link in computer security, the username and password.  WWPass delivers a secure and easy to use solution that provides unparalleled authentication security that is unmatched in the world today.
